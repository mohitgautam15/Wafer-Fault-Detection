# Wafer-Fault-Detection-System
The semiconductor industry demands high precision and accuracy during wafer production. Any imperfection, whether microscopic cracks, contaminants, or non-uniformities, can affect the final product's performance and reliability. To mitigate such risks, sensor-based fault detection systems are implemented, allowing real-time monitoring and immediate intervention.
